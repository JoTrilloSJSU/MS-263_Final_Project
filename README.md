# MS-263 Final Project
## Project Summary
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which contains a structured analysis of oceanographic microstructure data using the functions in the .py file and data contained in the python_analysis folder in this repository. Data and previous analysis used in the final project on Jupyter notebooks is contained in MATLAB_functions_and_analysis folder in this repository. Inside the MATLAB_functions_and_analysis the ODAS library in MATLAB and related functions. The analysis was developed for MS-263 (Spring 2025) and is designed to be run on systems with Jupyter notebooks and (optionally) MATLAB installed. Data that was too large to be put in this repository can be found in this google drive: xxxxxx

## Steps needed to run the analysis code on another computer
To run Jupyter Notebook containing the final project, copy and paste the python_analysis folder into Juptyter Notebooks/Jupyter Labs. All data needed for running the notebook are included in the folder and any necessary data_paths are correct as long as the structure of the folder remains unchanged.
## Location of data
### Processed/cleaned data:
Located in MATLAB_analysis_MS-263/data/
### Raw ODAS .p files and NetCDFs:
Available from Google Drive: need link
### Python-parsed or reformatted datasets:
Located in python_analysis/ or downloaded from the Drive folder above
